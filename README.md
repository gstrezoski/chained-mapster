# Quick deployment

To deploy your data-driven Python app, make sure you have [installed AZD](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd), and run the following commands and sequence and follow the prompts:

```shell
# CD to your Python app's repo root
cd <repo-root>
# Initialize a new azd environment with this template
azd init --template python-app-service-postgresql-infra
# Provision resources and deploy application code
azd up
```

When `azd` has finished deploying, you'll see some helpful output as provided by the template

- An endpoint URI for the web app.
- A link to the resource group in the Azure portal.
- A list of app settings generated by the template, and link to the app settings page in the Azure portal.
- A link to open an SSH session with the web app. This is useful to run database migrations manually.
- A link to the App Service logs.

When you've made any changes to your application code, you can just run:

```shell
azd deploy
```
